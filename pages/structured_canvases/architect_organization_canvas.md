The architecture organization canvas is a kind of business capability card specifically tailored to understanding and improving the architecture capability of an organization. Many architects are unaware even of how many architects are employed by the organization much less their type, interaction points and other key metrics. Specific focus is placed on the team [coverage and scope](../engagement_model/coverage.md) which defines metrics related to how well the architects are engaged in the overall organization, the effectiveness of business to solution (strategy to execution), the percentage of important decisions which are being made with thorough decision records as well as the overall stakeholder engagement. In addition, the people, process, and technology sections allow the architecture practice to reason about how and with who, and with what technology they work. Finally, a maturity estimation is provided to allow the team to estimate their current maturity and performance as well as link to goals for improvement.

| Team Size                       | This should included all titled architects both FTE as well as contractors in the practice.                                                                                                                                                  |                     |
