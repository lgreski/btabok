Product and project team assignments and structure are deeply important to the success of any solution. Aligning the competencies of the architect(s) and the team(s) will have a huge impact on the outcomes. The goal of the Team Designer, Assignments and prioritization activities go together very well whether using agile or more traditional methods of delivery. 

The best use of the team designer is to facilitate a team discussion on roles, interactions and expectations.
