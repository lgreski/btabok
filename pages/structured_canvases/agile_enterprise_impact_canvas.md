The agile impact canvas is used to describe the overall impact of agile methods on an enterprise, team, or domain. The canvas is a tool for thinking about impacts to business models, organization structures, culture, and more. It works best if used as a facilitation tool with a multi-faceted team who are brainstorming the best ways to make agile work in their organizations.
