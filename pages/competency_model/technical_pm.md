# Description

Technical Project Management is the ability to support the management of an IT initiative from a concept through to a concrete deliverable as a project with specialist technical knowledge. Working with a project requires that we have clear goals, a defined scope and a definite start and end.

In general we would expect a Administrative Project Management to have overall responsibility for the project and the Technical Project Management performing a supporting role in the many aspects of project management.

Technical Project Management differs from Administrative Project Management in that specific knowledge about technologies, applied methodologies and development models are required to ensure success in planning, estimation and execution of the project. Technical Project Management provides support to ensure the project is run effectively employing both project and development models (or SDLC) which provides an organization and working processes to help the project team successfully delivery the project.

It is not uncommon that the Architect can hold both the Administrative Project Management and Technical Project Management roles. This can depend on the organization or geographical culture in different countries, or even the size of the project. However in our definition of the Architect role the skills lie firmly in the Technical Project Management domain.

# Overview

**Why does an architect need this skill?**

In many IT projects we are transitioning from a current architecture to a new architecture and as an Architect we need Technical Project Management skills in order to realize this transition. Administrative Project Management does not have the depth of technical knowledge required to plan, execute and deliver the project and therefore relies on the support of Technical Project Management typically provided by the Architect.

Working IT Projects often differs from projects in other industries in that we work with conceptual models and requirements which are often difficult to define. The IT branch is dynamic and tools, standards and business requirements have a high rate of change. This poses a real challenge for IT projects and Administrative Project Management particularly in long term projects. A part of a project team the Architect can use Technical Project Management skills to support management of business and technical requirements, support the project team in successfully executing activities and support the general management of the project.

**Common tasks involved in this skill?**

Technical Project Management is a broad area and each project is unique and roles can be formed differently depending on the given project. However the following are some of the common tasks which we can expect within Technical Project Management.

*   Leadership and Management
*   Supporting Administrative Project Management in defining the Business Case for a project
*   Support definition of project scope
*   Translation of business requirements into technical requirements
*   Managing time and resources
*   Communication and presentation skills
*   Control and Monitoring of progress

 **What is their ownership in this skill?**

The Architect will support Administrative Project Management using this skills and provide leadership for the team form a technical perspective. Depending on the project organization the Architect may work in an advisory capacity to Administrative Project Management or may even have a mandate to make decisions regarding specific areas of the project.

**How is this skill used by the architect in daily activities?**

The Architect would be expected to be able to:

*   **Perform detailed planning and support Administrative Project Management in planning**
*   The Architect performs planning of technical activities for the team, as well as estimation of time and resources for the activities. Support is also given to Administrative Project Management in the broader project planning. The Architect also supports Administrative Project Management with definition of the Business Case.
*   **Support Administrative Project Management in defining and analyzing the project requirements**
*   This involves requirements gathering activities with the project sponsor, both functional and non-functional (quality attributes included). The Architect also provides support in structuring the requirements in some form of Requirements Specification.
*   **Communicate and describe the scope and requirements to the project team**
*   The Architect ensures consistently that the team understands the requirements and how they translate to a technical perspective. The Architect provides leadership for the team and guides them as to what is “in scope” and “out of scope”.
*   **Monitor the progress and support risk management**
*   The Architect will monitor the progress of the team and raise any potential risks with Administrative Project Management. The Architect will also describe the consequences of changes and support Administrative Project Management in mitigating risks.

**Support delivery of the project**

The Architect shall support delivery of the project ensuring that all technical deliverables are accounted for and the requirements placed on the project have been met by the solution. The Architect shall also support the evaluation of the project effect assessing if the Business Value delivered meets the project Business Case.

# Proven Practices

**Describe why an architect should be involved in this skill at a corporate level**

The Architect often provides the link between business and IT and a comprehensive understanding of the complexity of IT initiatives. This makes the Architect a valuable asset in project management contributing with a unique perspective on planning, estimation and risks which may not be apparent to an Administrative Project Management. Understanding the technical challenges in an IT project also facilitates communication with the project team and other stakeholders.

**Primary push back and/or challenges for architects**

As an Architect it is challenging to balance the concerns of the project with the concerns of the architecture. We often want to deliver the best possible architecture but at the same time we may be constrained by the time plan, budget and resources. This may mean that Architect will have to balance and prioritize the most important aspects of the architecture to fit with the project budget and resources.

**How would a stakeholder engage an architect for assistance utilizing this skill?**

Stakeholders can engage the Architect at any stage in a project either in a supporting or in a review capacity, however there are serious benefits from involving the Architect from the very beginning at project initiation. A Stakeholder can use the Architect in an advisory capacity ensuring the feasibility of the project, this is in terms of business case, surrounding business eco system and technology. This can help to set the boundaries of the project and reduce risk, for example ensuring that expected quality can be achieved with the given resources and early mitigation of risks increases the chances of the project being a success.
